                Ephraim Knowlton Hanks, is called on behalf of the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to settle colonies in southern Utah. It was Ephraim's family who initially built a small ranch near Pleasant Creek. Over the years they built a five bedroom home, planted crops, and grew an abundance of fruit trees in the area. In the Spring the fruit trees blossom, giveing inspiration to the name 'Floral Ranch'. Floral Ranch remained in the family until 1916 before passing through ownership over the next few decades.

                Lurt Knee and his first wife Margaret decide to purchase the land with the intent of beginning a guest ranch after their car breaks down on the property. By 1940, Lurt is able to build a series of new structures northeast of the original Hank House and covert the property into a day-tour operation. It is at this point that the ranch officially obtains its new name, 'Sleeping Rainbow Ranch'. According to Lurt Knee in a 1992 interview, when he first built the ranch and realized it was adjacent to a national monument, his goal was to make it into a National Park.
