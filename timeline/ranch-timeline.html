            Ephraim Knowlton Hanks, is called on behalf of the president of the
            Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to settle colonies in
            southern Utah. It was Ephraim's family who initially built a small
            ranch near Pleasant Creek. Over the years they built a five bedroom
            home, planted crops, and grew an abundance of fruit trees in the
            area. In the Spring the fruit trees blossom, giveing inspiration to
            the name 'Floral Ranch'. Floral Ranch remained in the family until
            1916 before passing through ownership over the next few decades.

            Lurt Knee and his first wife Margaret decide to purchase the land
            with the intent of beginning a guest ranch after their car breaks
            down on the property. By 1940, Lurt is able to build a series of new
            structures northeast of the original Hank House and covert the
            property into a day-tour operation. It is at this point that the
            ranch officially obtains its new name, 'Sleeping Rainbow Ranch'.
            According to Lurt Knee in a 1992 interview, when he first built the
            ranch and realized it was adjacent to a national monument, his goal
            was to make it into a National Park.

            The ranch operates as a commercial tourist operation. The Great
            Depression gratly affects tourism, but the industry recovers after
            1945 during the time that Sleeping Rainbow Ranch comes into
            fruition. The ranch begins to offer jeep tours, horseback riding
            along trails, and overnight lodging. While operating the ranch, Lurt
            marries Alice, his second and final wife.

            Capitol Reef national monument is expanded, which includes 300 acres
            of Lurt and Alice's property. By now, the Knees have built and
            maintained an irrigation canal, a spring and pump water system, and
            telephone lines on the property. The guest ranch has been expanded
            to 15 outbuildings, pastures, and corrals. Lurt and Alice continue
            to run the ranch together until deciding to close the operation in
            1974. The Knees spend the rest of their lives on the property, and
            Alice is considered its last resident after Lurt passes away in
            1995. After Lurt's passing Alice quit-claims her rights to the
            property, and the NPS assumes ownership.

            In March of 2000, a deal is struck between the NPS and the Utah
            Valley State College, or what is currently known as, Utah Valley University.
            Today, Sleeping Rainbow Ranch is the locale of UVU's Capitol Reef
            Field Station, sitting directly above the remnants of Sleeping
            Rainbow Ranch. Every season, students from all areas of academia
            come here to learn, build, and benefit off of all that this
            beautiful land continues to offer today.
