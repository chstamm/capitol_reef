# Capitol Reef Remote Website

## Links to Files

The idea here is to create this website to be hosted remotely on raspberry pis. To do this, we needed to make sure that the website we would create wouldn't make calls out to different websites that we wouldn't have connection to, so the goal was to get all the information from the script and font links and make them into files so this website can run it's AR componants. Below is a list of links and the associated file names so that we can refer back to these links and update the website if needed.
